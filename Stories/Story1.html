                        MasterMind</u>.
                </p>
                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">I'm a university student entering my second year
                    in September
                    2024, studying software engineering in
                    Canada. I used to have two businesses, one was a marketing agency offering short-form content and
                    the other was an AI Automation Agency. My marketing agency was running pretty well, making around
                    <u>$500-$700</u> per month. I know it's not a lot, üòÇ.
                </p>

                <h1 class="mt-7 text-4xl font-bold max-x-sm:text-2xl">A little bit about me:</h1>

                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">While I am building Tech MasterMind, I am also
                    working my
                    first internship at a Steel Factory as an
                    IT student.</p>

                <h1 class="mt-7 text-4xl font-bold max-x-sm:text-2xl">What is Tech MasterMind?</h1>


                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">It's a website where I will interview a bunch of
                    <strong>techpreneurs and software engineers</strong>
                    to share their journey on how they become successful and share some advice for someone who wants to
                    do the same.
                </p>

                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">I want to interview techpreneurs, basically
                    founders who
                    started a tech/software company, to see how they got started.</p>
                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">I also want to interview a bunch of <u>9-5
                        developers</u> on
                    how they landed their first job and their journey up to this point.</p>
                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">I feel like there are a lot of myths going
                    around the world.
                    The first being that working a 9-5 job is running your life and the second being that it is
                    impossible to get a <u>CS internship</u> in this job market. Now, even I think that getting an
                    internship in this job market is hard, well, at least in Canada.</p>
                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">This is why I want to interview developers so
                    that current CS
                    students, like me, can have a <u>blueprint to follow</u>, giving themselves a higher chance than
                    others. And as for the first myth, yeah, I don‚Äôt believe that (The effect of social media and how it
                    has changed how we think).</p>

                <h1 class="mt-7 text-4xl font-bold max-x-sm:text-2xl">Challenges:</h1>
                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">I only worked on this project for 3 days and
                    encountered a few
                    challenges that I need to overcome. The first challenge is finding people to interview. I've sent
                    some cold emails, but the main issue is finding suitable interviewees. I've used YouTube and blogs
                    as a starting point, but I need to come up with a better plan. The second problem is centering a
                    button on my website üòÇü§®.</p>

                <h1 class="mt-7 text-4xl font-bold max-x-sm:text-2xl">How I came up with this idea? Why is this a good
                    idea?</h1>
                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">So as I mentioned before that I am going into
                    second year and
                    many students, including myself, start working on side projects to add to their portfolios. When I
                    opened VSCode I had no idea what I wanted to build, so I went on YouTube to do some research. That's
                    when I came across Pat Walls, founder of <a href="https://www.starterstory.com/"
                        class="underline decoration-blue-500" target="_blank">Starter Story.</a> I was already familiar
                    with Pat and rewatched one of his
                    videos on
                    <u class="underline decoration-blue-500"><a class="editor-rtfLink decoration-dashed"
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_wEmB5MapE" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                            target="_blank">"How I Built A $1M Business From This
                            Starbucks"</a></u> and he says ‚ÄúI can turn these questions into a product‚Äù, which sparked
                    the idea for something similar to Starter Story.
                </p>

                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">This led to the creation of <u>Tech
                        MasterMind</u>, inspired by
                    Starter Story but with my own unique twist. I then had the thought of creating something to guide
                    current CS students, like me, in the right direction and also inspire entrepreneurs to start their
                    own tech companies.</p>
                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">Now here is the best part I can showcase this
                    project on my
                    portfolio, making it look impressive since I've created something that aims to solve a problem. It's
                    a <strong>win-win</strong>.</p>

                <h1 class="mt-7 text-4xl font-bold max-x-sm:text-2xl">Monthly Goal:</h1>
                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">I got the idea to start Tech MasterMind on July
                    23, 2024, and
                    I'm writing this on the 26th, so there's not much time left this month. My main goal for this month
                    is to complete the development of the website, deploy it online, and post at least 3 blogs. I also
                    aim to set up Google Analytics, although I'm not sure how to do this. I'll hopefully be able to
                    figure it out by searching online.</p>
                <p class="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">I‚Äôll keep you guys posted see you next month and
                    don‚Äôt forget
                    to subscribe by putting your email below.</p>
